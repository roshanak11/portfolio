            </p>
            <h3>
              My passion for learning, desire to be mentored, growth-mindset, and ability to receive feedback will make me a valuable asset to your industry. I have always been passionate about technology from a young age. I first taught myself how to code when I was 10 years old and won technology awards in school for having the highest score on various projects 5 years in a row. I love using code to construct projects that provide real solutions to real world problems. I have a global mindset, I have lived in 3 continents and speak several languages. I am open-minded and I get along with people of all demographics and backgrounds. I would like to join a team that values both my skill set and provides a good work-life balance.
