            I have lived in 3 continents (North America, Europe, and Asia) and have traveled to the following 15 countries so far:
            <h2>
              <h4>Europe:</h4> England, Italy, France
              <br></br>
              <h4>Asia:</h4> Maldives, Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong, India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, China, Qatar, UAE
              <br></br>
              <h4>North America:</h4> USA, Mexico
              <br></br>
            </h2>
            I plan to travel to as many countries as possible within my lifetime. I enjoy learning about new cultures. I also love learning and practicing different languages. I am bilingual in English and Bengali. I learned how to read and write Bengali at a beginner level from the ages of 12-16. I also studied French for 8 years at a beginner level and received a 6/7 score on the International Baccalaureate French Level B exam. In my spare time, I use Duolingo to brush up on my French skills.
            During my childhood I was also exposed to Hindi and Urdu, and I took one Spanish class in college. My goal is to continue to sharpen and expand my language skills.          </p>
